The code implements a lightweight Transformer-based neural network named RTTransformer for a multiclass classification task using PyTorch. It is optimized for structured tabular data, providing both accuracy and computational efficiency.

Below is a breakdown of the main components:

1. Model Architecture Definition
A custom class RTTransformer is defined with the following structure:

Input Linear Layer:

python
Copy
Edit
self.input_linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, d_model)
Projects the original feature dimension into the Transformerâ€™s model dimension (d_model).

Transformer Encoder:

python
Copy
Edit
nn.TransformerEncoder(...)
Applies multi-head self-attention to model dependencies between input features. Uses num_layers=4 and num_heads=8.

Global Average Pooling:

python
Copy
Edit
x = x.mean(dim=1)
Aggregates the sequence dimension into a fixed-size vector for classification.

Fully Connected Output Layer:

python
Copy
Edit
self.fc_out = nn.Linear(d_model, num_classes)
Outputs logits for classification into two classes (num_classes=2).

2. Model Initialization
The model is instantiated with:

python
Copy
Edit
model = RTTransformer(
    input_dim=X_train.shape[1],
    d_model=64,
    num_heads=8,
    num_layers=4,
    num_classes=2
)
The model is moved to the appropriate device (e.g., GPU or CPU) for training.

3. Training Configuration
Loss Function:
nn.CrossEntropyLoss() â€“ suitable for multi-class classification tasks.

Optimizer:
torch.optim.Adam() with a learning rate of 1e-3.

Epochs:
The model is trained over 100 epochs.

DataLoader:
Training data is wrapped in a PyTorch DataLoader for efficient mini-batch training (batch_size=256).

4. Training Loop
The training process includes:

Forward pass

Loss computation

Backward pass and parameter update

Accuracy calculation

Logging of training loss and accuracy

5. Validation Step
At the end of each epoch, the model is evaluated on the test set.

Validation predictions are generated and compared to the ground truth using accuracy_score from scikit-learn.

Validation accuracy is stored in val_accuracies.

6. Performance Monitoring
The model tracks and prints the following at each epoch:

Average training loss

Training accuracy

Validation accuracy

This enables easy performance visualization and debugging.

ðŸ’¡ Use Case
This model is particularly useful for:

Binary or multiclass classification on tabular data.

Tasks where attention-based models outperform classical MLPs or tree-based models.

Efficient training in environments with limited compute due to its compact architecture.
